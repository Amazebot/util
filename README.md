[Lerna][lerna] is used to link and publish packages that depend on each other, to streamline local development. These utilities can be used independently, but it still helps to share dev dependencies, test and build configuration.

All packages are written in Typescript and follow [Standard JS][standard] style, with a minimum of 80% test coverage.
